    <h1> Informative Report</h1> 
    <p> The central processing unit (CPU) is the most important processor in a given computer. Its electronic circuitry executes the instructions of a computer program. A CPU contains both cores and threads. A CPU core is the physical processing unit of a CPU. It is the component responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. Also, a CPU can have multiple cores, which allows it to run multiple tasks simultaneously. Therefore, cores are important because they are used to transmit information throughout your computer and allow you to make changes to files, so having more cores means faster processing. On the other hand, threads are the virtual components or codes, which divide the physical core of a CPU into virtual multiple cores. To be precise, a single CPU core can have up to 2 threads per core. They are important because they allow for parallel processing, enabling the CPU to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Hence, having more threads means being able to handle more programs at the same time.</p>
