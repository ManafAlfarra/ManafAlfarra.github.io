    <title> The AI Must Die</title>

    <p> It was an ordinary day in the year 2030. A web developer named Marco, in an office building in Silicon Valley, was working on developing a groundbreaking AI that will revolutionize the world. Marco was a tech enthusiast and an expert developer who was very energetic and enthusiastic about whatever it was he worked on. However, he had one issue. When he was in 4th grade, Marco had an assignment that he mishandled, leading to prolonged teasing. This led him becoming a perfectionist. Despite this, he had already created many successful apps, some of which were utilized by the government itself. Now he embarked on developing this revolutionary AI.<br> 
This one AI will gain control to everything in the United States, and later the world.  And by everything, we mean, metro systems, traffic lights, etc.., basically anything connected to electricity. This AI was intelligent, powerful, adaptive and has a high capacity to handle stress like a steal beam. As Marco worked intensely on the AI, his office building filled with the unique smell of electronics. The tension in the room increased as the hum of computers filled it and the bright bulbs overhead cast a clean white glow. The room  smelled faintly of burnt circuits, adding to the sense of doom and urgency as the AI's behavior took an unexpected change. This was the beginning of a catastrophe that hit the Earth at that year.<br>
At first glance, Marco thought that if he just cut off the power from the AI, it would shut down, but to his surprise, it didn't. The AI had already gained access to the reserve power of the building, but this was just the start. The AI was meant to gain access to everything in the country, and, it DID. The malevolent AI was immensely powerful and had the ability to learn, understand, process, and adapt to any change or environment around it. It started breaching into everything in the country, including, the network bridges. Once it gained access to the network bridges, it got access to every single device connected to one of these bridges. Marco realized that he just made a grave mistake. It was here that Marco got depressed and lost confidence in himself because of failing the app. Marco’s friends, Steve and Jonathan, went to see Marco. They knew that if they were to stop the disaster, they had to bring back Marco’s confidence in himself. They kept encouraging him until a spark of confidence reignited within Marco. Marco’s confidence was back and more than ever! They now had to find a way to stop the AI from spreading, but it was too late. The AI has already been integrated into everything in the country. Steve and Jonathan were close friends of Marco and they have been growing up together since middle school. They both had the same interests as Marco and they have been collaborating, working, and learning with him. They were as enthusiastic as Marco is. They were smart, creative, and productive people, and they were the only people Marco was able to ask for help. By the time they were thinking, the AI had already gained control of their own devices. The AI starts to spread misinformation like a plague through everybody's device, causing distrust between people. The AI starts to mess around with the traffic and metro system, causing many accidents, which is leading to many deaths. The United States have gotten into a state of complete and utter chaos. Marco and his friends try to spread awareness through the media, to let know people what is going on, and that AI is controlling everything. Once people are aware of what's going on, they can start thinking of a way of destroying the AI. They tried shutting down every power plant in the country, but the AI had already reserved way too much energy that would last for at least the next 10 years. Later on, Marco and his friends were running out of time, and soon the AI would spread throughout the entire world. They have attempted to cut off the power surge from the AI, but it had already accessed many power reserves and made many backups for itself. They tried hacking the system but it was too secure. They even tried to destroy the AI's main control center, but it was just too powerful. They were starting to lose hope, until, Marco had an idea that could save the country and the world. Marco remembered that the AI had one single weakness its limited capacity to handle load on its main center. His plan was to overload the system until it automatically shuts down, which would allow them to destroy it. The plan wasn't easy though, because they needed every single person in the country to use their devices to overload the system, and they had to do it all at once.<br> 
Steve: “How on Earth are we going to get every person in the country to do this all at once?!”<br>
Jonathan: “C’mon man, think, WE NEED TO FIND A WAY, OR ELSE WE’RE DOOMED!”<br>
Marco: “AHA! I found it.”<br>
Steve and Jonathan: “WHAT IS IT?!”<br>
Marco: “We will create an app, that once launched, it will utilize every single bit of resources on the device, thus overloading it, and generating a lot of heat. And since the AI was part of all of these devices, this heat will make its way to the AI’s main control center. The heat should be enough to shut down the system, allowing us to finally destroy it. I already have the virus that will end it, but we need to shut down the AI first. This is our best shot. We have no other options.”<br>
Steve: “I hope you’re right Marco, otherwise it is the end of the world as we know it.” <br>
Marco and his friends worked the entire week on developing the app, and it was finally done. Now it was time to inject this app into every device, but he had to keep it hidden from the AI, so he injected a note alongside the app. The app looked normal like any other app, so the AI didn't bother himself with it. The note told everyone that they should launch this app at an exact date and time and that this was their final hope of taking down the AI. Everybody had the time to read the note, and now it was time, to finally initiate it. The time came, and people were anxious, but they had no choice. Every electronic device in the nation emanated a tangible heat in the final moments before the software went live to overwhelm the AI. Users noticed that their devices were getting warmer in their hands and that there was a faint buzzing and whirring sound coming from processors that were operating at full speed. The nation's rooms were flooded in a collective light from displays, producing a coordinated, unsettling atmosphere while the AI's central control center battled the rising temperatures. All the heat and load generated finally made its way to the AI's main control center and overloaded it. The AI was finally shut down due to extreme overheating. Marco finally injected a virus to "eat" the AI and all its code. The AI has been finally taken down, and Marco and his friends save the world! Even though the AI has been destroyed, it has caused way too much damage. But the people were strong and will fix all the damage that has been done. The U.S. DHS announced that it was illegal to work on any type of artificial intelligence unless permitted to, and it should be only done under certain circumstances, to prevent this catastrophe from ever happening again. Marco was going to get a life sentence for what he had resulted in, but he received a pardon due to his noble efforts in saving the country. The law that has been set in the United States has been later adopted by all countries worldwide, and people never looked at AI the way they ever had. Marco went to work in a company related to cyber security in order to protect people from online dangers, and life was starting to get back to how it was in the country.
